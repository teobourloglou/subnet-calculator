# ðŸ“¡ Subnet Calculator

## Overview

The **Subnet Calculator** is a simple tool designed to facilitate subnet calculations for IPv4 addresses.

## About

I created this project to gain a deeper understanding of the logic behind subnetting. There's no better way to learn than to rebuild it from scratch! Enjoy the same subnet calculator as any other you can find on Google, but with at least 40% better styling.

## Given Results

- **Network Address:** Represents the starting point of a network. It is the first address in a subnet and is used to identify the network itself.
- **Usable Host IP Range:** Refers to the range of IP addresses within a subnet that can be assigned to devices, excluding the network address and the broadcast address. These are the IP addresses available for assigning to individual devices or hosts on the network.
- **Broadcast Address:** The last address in a subnet and is used to broadcast messages to all devices within that subnet. It is not assigned to any specific device but is used for network communication.
- **Number of Usable Hosts:** Represents the total number of IP addresses within a subnet that can be assigned to individual devices or hosts, excluding the network address and the broadcast address.
- **Total Number of Hosts:** This includes all possible IP addresses within a subnet, including the network address and the broadcast address. It represents the total capacity of the subnet, both for host assignments and other purposes.
- **CIDR Notation:** Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated routing prefix. It is commonly used in networking to simplify the representation of IP addresses and their routing information. For example, "/24" in CIDR notation represents a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
- **Wildcard Mask:** It is used in networking for access control lists (ACLs) and defines which portions of an IP address should be treated as significant for matching. It is derived from the inverse of the subnet mask. In other words, where the subnet mask has a "1," the wildcard mask has a "0," and vice versa.
